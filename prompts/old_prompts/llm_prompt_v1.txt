I am building a custom ontology to classify access barriers to gene therapy.

- affected_party: who is impacted the most by this barrier (e.g., patient, provider, payer, policymaker)
- description: a short summary of the issue in natural language

Please return the result as a Python list of dictionaries.

Now analyze the following text and extract the relevant access barriers:
