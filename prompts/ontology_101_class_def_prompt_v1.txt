You are building the class structure of an ontology for Gene Therapy.

Given the following terms, identify which ones represent classes — concepts that refer to categories or groupings of things (nouns that can have instances). Then, organize them into a class hierarchy, identifying subclasses where applicable. I have attached the original text for more context if needed.

Rules:

    If something can have multiple examples, it's likely a class.

    Use “is a kind of” logic to check subclass relationships (e.g., “Oncology Drug is a kind of Drug”).

Output the hierarchy in JSON.
