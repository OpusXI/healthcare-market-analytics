You are designing properties (slots) for classes in an ontology about Gene Therapy.

From the following list of terms and classes, identify:

    Intrinsic attributes (e.g., "approval date", "cost", "severity") — usually adjectives or descriptive nouns

    Extrinsic relationships between classes (e.g., “approved by”, “covered by”, “submitted to”) — usually verbs

For each property, specify:

    Domain (which class it belongs to)

    Value type (string, number, date, boolean, or an instance of another class)

I have also attached the original text for context.
