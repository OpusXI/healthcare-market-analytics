2. Domain concepts (e.g., Price Negotiation, Reimbursement Delay, Regulatory Approval)
3. Access barrier types (categorize as Financial, Regulatory, Logistical, Clinical, Political)

Organize your output as JSON:
{
  "Entities": {
    "Drug": [],
    "Country": [],
    "Stakeholder": [],
    ...
  },
  "Concepts": [],
  "Barriers": [
    {
      "label": "",
      "type": "Regulatory/Financial/etc",
      "example_from_text": ""
    }
