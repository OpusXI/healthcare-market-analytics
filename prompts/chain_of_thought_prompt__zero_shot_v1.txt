Analyze the following text and perform the following steps in order to construct a custom ontology for the domain of gene therapy. Follow a structured reasoning process and explain each step clearly:

1) Key Term Extraction:
    - Identify and extract key domain-specific terms, especially focusing on nouns, proper nouns, verbs, pronouns, and adjectives.
    - Return a list of extracted terms, categorized by part of speech.

2) Ontology Class Discovery:
    - From the nouns and proper nouns, identify potential ontology classes. These represent key concepts in gene therapy (e.g., Vector, Gene, Patient, Treatment).
    - Group these classes into a hierarchical structure (superclass â†’ subclass) based on generality. For example:
        {Entity: [{BiologicalEntity: [Gene, Protein], {Therapy: [GeneTherapy, Immunotherapy]}}]}

3) Slot / Property Definition

    - Use the verbs and adjectives to define slots or properties for each class. These describe what the class does or how it is described. For example:
        {Class: Vector, Properties: [deliversGene, isViral, hasEfficiency]}

4) Relationship Modeling
    - Model relationships between classes by linking slot values to instances or other classes. For example: GeneTherapy has a property usesVector whose value is an instance of Vector class.
    - Express relationships as slot-based links, emphasizing that slot values are often instances of other classes.

5) Return Structured Ontology
    - Output the ontology in a structured format (e.g., JSON-LD-like structure or RDF-style triples if needed).
    - Ensure it includes: Class definitions and hierarchies, Properties (slots) and their domains/ranges, Inter-class relationships
