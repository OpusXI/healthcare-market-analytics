Gene therapy has shown incredible promise in treating rare genetic disorders, with several recent trials demonstrating positive outcomes. In 2023, over 50 new therapies were in development globally. However, the cost of treatment can exceed $2 million, presenting a significant challenge for both private insurers and national healthcare systems. A recent panel discussion at the Rare Disease Congress in Berlin emphasized the need for new pricing models. Meanwhile, advancements in viral vector design are improving delivery efficiency, though rural hospitals often still lack proper refrigeration equipment. Public perception of gene editing remains mixed, and some advocacy groups are calling for more transparency in clinical trial data. In Europe, differences in regulatory approval timelines are slowing market access in certain countries.
